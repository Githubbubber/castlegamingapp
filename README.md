# Castle Gaming Website Application

Castle Gaming is a NYC-based video game tournament collective. They also provide services for outside orgs/collectives to throw their own tournaments.

The [Castle Gaming app][http://www.castlegaming.net/] - I built a fully developed Node JS app deployed on the Heroku hosting platform. I encountered some hiccups while deploying the app but it finally worked out.

It uses three APIs:
- [The New York Times][https://developer.nytimes.com/]
- [Twitch][https://dev.twitch.tv/]
- [GiantBomb][https://www.giantbomb.com/api/]

I also used the simple, light-weight [Skeleton CSS framework][http://getskeleton.com/]. It always gives me the freedom to concentrate on the content of a site without worrying about how it looked on mobile devices.

Thanks for visiting!
