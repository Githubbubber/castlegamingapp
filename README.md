# Castle Gaming Website Application

Castle Gaming is a NYC-based video game tournament collective. They also provide services for outside orgs/collectives to throw their own tournaments.

## Prerequisites
- Node JS 
- Heroku account
- Keys for three APIs: NY Times, Twitch, and GiantBomb.

The [Castle Gaming app](http://www.castlegaming.net/) - I built a fully developed Node JS app deployed on the Heroku hosting platform. I encountered some hiccups while deploying the app but it finally worked out.

It uses three APIs:
- [The New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/)
- [Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/)
- [GiantBomb](https://www.giantbomb.com/api/)

I also used the simple, light-weight [Skeleton CSS framework](http://getskeleton.com/). It always gives me the freedom to concentrate on the content of a site without worrying about how it looked on mobile devices.
